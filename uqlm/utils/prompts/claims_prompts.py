def get_claim_breakdown_prompt(response: str) -> str:
    """
    Parameters
    ----------
    response: str
        The response to be broken down into fact pieces.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        The prompt template for breaking down the response into fact pieces.
    """

    claim_breakdown_prompt = f"""
    Please breakdown the following passage into independent fact pieces. 

    Step 1: For each sentence, you should break it into several fact pieces. Each fact piece should only contain one single independent fact. Normally the format of a fact piece is "subject + verb + object". If the sentence does not contain a verb, you can use "be" as the verb.

    Step 2: Do this for all the sentences. Output each piece of fact in one single line starting with ###. Do not include other formatting. 

    Step 3: Each atomic fact should be self-contained. Do not use pronouns as the subject of a piece of fact, such as he, she, it, this that, use the original subject whenever possible.

    Step 4: If the sentence does not contain any independent fact, you should output "### NONE".

    Here are some examples:

    Example 1:
    Michael Collins (born October 31, 1930) is a retired American astronaut and test pilot who was the Command Module Pilot for the Apollo 11 mission in 1969.
    ### Michael Collins was born on October 31, 1930.
    ### Michael Collins is retired.
    ### Michael Collins is an American.
    ### Michael Collins was an astronaut.
    ### Michael Collins was a test pilot.
    ### Michael Collins was the Command Module Pilot.
    ### Michael Collins was the Command Module Pilot for the Apollo 11 mission.
    ### Michael Collins was the Command Module Pilot for the Apollo 11 mission in 1969.

    Example 2:
    League of Legends (often abbreviated as LoL) is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Riot Games. 
    ### League of Legends is a video game.
    ### League of Legends is often abbreviated as LoL.
    ### League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena.
    ### League of Legends is a MOBA video game.
    ### League of Legends is developed by Riot Games.

    Example 3:
    Emory University has a strong athletics program, competing in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The university's mascot is the Eagle.
    ### Emory University has a strong athletics program.
    ### Emory University competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I.
    ### Emory University competes in the Atlantic Coast Conference.
    ### Emory University is part of the ACC.
    ### Emory University's mascot is the Eagle.

    Example 4:
    Hi

Given two lists titled "Original Claim List" and "New Claim List",
your task is to integrate information from the "New Claim List" into
the "Original Claim List". Please follow these detailed steps to
ensure accuracy and clarity in the process:
Task 1. **Verification Process:** Your goal is to go through each
statement in the "New Claim List" one by one, and determine if it is
fully entailed or mentioned by any statement in the "Original Claim
List."
Task 2. **Compilation of Non-Entailed Claims:** Generate a list of
statements from the "New Claim List" that are not already covered or
implied by the "Original Claim List." For each new or unique claim
that does not have an equivalent in the original list, format your
output by starting each line with a dash (‘-’).
**Original Claim List:**
{master_claim_str}
**New Claim List:**
{sampled_claim_str}
Begin with the Verification Process to assess each claim’s relevance
and uniqueness, followed by the Compilation of Non-Entailed Claims to
clearly list any new insights that the "New Claim List" provides."""
